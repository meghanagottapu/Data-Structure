DATA STRUCTUREüëÄ

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.

TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE:

1) Linked lists :
  A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item as well as a reference, or link, to the next item in the list
2) Trees :
  A tree stores a collection of items in an abstract, hierarchical way. Each node is linked to other nodes and can have multiple sub-values, also known as children
3) Graphs :
  A graph stores a collection of items in a non-linear fashion. Graphs are made up of a finite set of nodes, also known as vertices, and lines that connect them, also known as edges. These are useful for representing real-life systems such as computer networks.
4) Queues : 
  A queue stores a collection of items similar to a stack; however, the operation order can only be first in first out.
5) Binary Search Tree :
  A Binary Tree is a tree data structure wherein each node has at most two ‚Äúchildren.‚Äù
  A node in the binary tree typically contains the following properties:
    Reference to the left child.
    Reference to the right child.
    Data
6) MinHeap :
  The root node has the minimum value.The value of each node is equal to or greater than the value of its parent node.A complete binary tree.
7) MaxHeap :
  The root node has the maximum value.The value of each node is equal to or less than the value of its parent node.A complete binary tree.
